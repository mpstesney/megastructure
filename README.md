Megastructure
=============

This repository demonstrates the use of an L-system to create fictional megastructures. 

The megastructure has two primary building elements, residential branches assembled from many small nodes and singular large hubs comprised of a single node. Although represented as a hub with radiating branches in this report, the L-system rules could be written to create other configurations such as a long chain of alternating hubs and branches.

The Grasshopper and GhPython code have three primary components. First, there is the L-system rewriting block of code. Here the axiom, productions (rules), number of iterations and random seed are defined by user input. A GhPython code block employs the node substitution technique to rewrite the axiom and subsequent iterations. The rewriting process has two additional capacities. Length and angle parameters can be included in the rules if scalar modification of the modular dimensions is desired. Also, branch length can be limited by specifying the maximum quantity of a given node in the branch.

The output string generated by the writing process is passed to the second GhPython component. This component translates the relational information of the input string into absolute locations within a three-dimensional space. User defined length and angle modular dimensions, scaled as necessary, are incorporated at this stage in the process. A list of nodes, along with the positional state at that node, are output as a list. In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the positional state includes the X, Y and Z axis vectors. All state information is included in a single Grasshopper Plane object.

The third GhPython component translates the node types into parameters necessary to create Grasshopper primitives located in accordance with their associated state and sized per the dimension module. The parameters are output by node type into Grasshopper components that create the actual primitives. Finally, the base geometry of the primitives is developed into the megastructure architecture using Grasshopper components.

## Code

To run the code in Grasshopper, copy each Python file into its own GhPython Grasshopper component.
